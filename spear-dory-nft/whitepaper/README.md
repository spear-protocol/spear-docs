# Whitepaper

The SPEAR Dory Collection is a **one of a kind NFT project** that is designed not only to fund the development of the SPEAR Protocol, our solution to the [Blockchain Trilemma](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma) for a stablecoin-based economy, but also to be an integral part of the upcoming SPEAR network's security and decentralization.

We believe that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology allow for the democratization of the global financial system and the empowerment of the common man. We consciously decided to bootstrap this project via NFT crowdfunding for two reasons:

1. Starting the right way by giving control and ownership of the network to the people.
2. Avoid VC funding in the beginning that may lead to unintended centralization tendencies.

Because of our belief in this mission, we didn't want to create an NFT project that is just a derivative of past projects. We carefully and thoughtfully worked through its concepts and design in regards to the [utility](https://docs.spear.technology/spear-dory-nft/whitepaper/nft-utility), [supply schedule](https://docs.spear.technology/spear-dory-nft/whitepaper/supply-schedule), and [mint mechanics](https://docs.spear.technology/spear-dory-nft/whitepaper/mint-mechanics) of the SPEAR Dory Collection. This embodies our vision for a decentralized future and we are fully determined for SPEAR to stand the test of time.
