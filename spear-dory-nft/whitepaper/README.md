# Whitepaper

## Bootstrapping the SPEAR Network Through Community Ownership

### Abstract

Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology enable the democratization of the global financial system and the empowerment of the common man. Because of our belief in this mission, we created the SPEAR Dory NFT Collection - a **one of a kind NFT project** that is designed to not only fund the development of the [SPEAR Protocol](https://docs.spear.technology/spear-protocol/whitepaper), our solution to the Blockchain Trilemma for a stablecoin-based economy, but also be an integral part in the security and decentralization of the upcoming SPEAR network. The concept and design of Dory's [utility](https://docs.spear.technology/spear-dory-nft/whitepaper/nft-utility), [supply schedule](https://docs.spear.technology/spear-dory-nft/whitepaper/supply-schedule), and [mint mechanics](https://docs.spear.technology/spear-dory-nft/whitepaper/mint-mechanics) have been carefully and thoughtfully worked upon which embodies our vision for a decentralized future. We are fully determined for SPEAR to stand the test of time and make a lasting change in the world.&#x20;
